Assuming preprocessed data for 7 days is already present..
Follow the steps:
0. Need to download alibaba_traces_preprocessed_data_7_days.csv
1. Scala -> Run DataToMatrix.sc. This will create two folders svc_traceid_map and the matrix.
2. Python -> MatrixToAppTraces.py
3. Scala -> Run AppToServiceGraphs.sc and AppTracesToUniqueCGs.sc
4. Python -> create_app_dags.py

At the end of it, you should have a folder in datasets/alibaba called AlibabaApps which has 4 folders and 3 csv files:
c1_nodes_atmost, apps, cpm, eval, apps_metadata.csv, lp_run.csv (fig_17_c), cdf_data_fig_17_b.csv

To-dos:
Write a single script to execute this in a single command.
